# Evolutionary-Algorithms-for-Traveling-Salesman-Problem

This project investigates the application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), an optimization challenge where the objective is to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point. The implementation is developed using Python and evaluates the performance of various EA configurations on datasets representing city maps from Brazil and Burma.
